This is a E-commerce sales dashboard, where I analyze the e-commerce data of a year. Here we get sum of sales and sum of profit from which we can understand whole year profit. 
we also get sum of profit by region from which we get to know that East region have the maximum profit and west region have lowest sum of profit. 
January and November is the month which have maximum profit because in January month New year sales was provided and in November month Diwali sales was provided. 
Office supplies category was the most selling category of all. In this a sub-category called Art have the most sales followed by copiers of Technology category and then labels of Art category.
